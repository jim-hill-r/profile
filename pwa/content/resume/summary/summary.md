I have over 15 years of experience in software, mechanical, and manufacturing engineering in industries including healthcare, education, automotive, mining, aviation and power generation. During my career, I have held roles as a design engineer, applications engineer, software engineer, and software architect at Caterpillar, Renishaw, GE Digital, and IMO respectively. Combining this experience with a pair of Master's Degrees in Mechanical and Software Engineering allows me to provide a comprehensive view of how digital technology can help solve the real challenges by our modern world.
